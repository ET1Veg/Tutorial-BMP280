Getting [NULL] fields in SerialMonitor and these are passed to SignalK using Tutorial-BMP280 code "out of the box"

Believe the problem may be in: main.cpp in this declaration
	// (Do whatever is required to "start" your project's sensor here)
	// Initialize the BMP280 using the default address
  bmp280.begin();

-------------------------------------------------------------------
bool Adafruit_BMP280::begin(uint8_t addr = (uint8_t)119U, uint8_t chipid = (uint8_t)88U)
Initialises the sensor.

Parameters:
addr – The I2C address to use (default = 0x77)
chipid – The expected chip ID (used to validate connection).

Returns:
True if the init was successful, otherwise false.
--------------------------------------------------------------------

changed to 
  bmp280.begin(0x76,0x60);


I had a heck of a time figuring out that not only must the address be specified but the chip ID also
I realized the chip i was using was not at the default address (0x77) due to modification in a previous installation
when i passed the actual address (0x76) i noticed the serial o/p was passing 0+237.15 instead of [NULL] to SignalK
took another 4-hours to realize that an ID must also be passed with the address
still more time to realize i had a BME280 vs a BMP280 in spite of board stencil and ID needed to be 0x60 vs 0x58 (see link below)

I am currently using DevBoard pins 20 and 17 for i2c bus (p20=D21=SDA, p17=D22=SCL). I will experiment with reallocation of i2c bus later.
