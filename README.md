# Tutorial-BMP280
Files used for the Tutorial that shows how to read an Adafruit BMP280 temperature / pressure sensor.

main.cpp reads only temperature, to keep it simple, and to make it possible to simply clone / download and build.

BAS: link to this in the documentation when the documentation is done. And add a link here to the documentation for the Tutorial that uses this.
