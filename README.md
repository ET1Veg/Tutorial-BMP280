# Tutorial-BMP280
Files used for the Tutorial that shows how to read an Adafruit BMP280 temperature / pressure sensor.

main.cpp reads only temperature, to keep it simple, and to make it possible to simply clone / download and build.

Changes in this branch required to get two ESP32_devkit_v1 processor boards to behave properly.
