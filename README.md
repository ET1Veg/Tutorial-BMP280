# Tutorial-BMP280
Files used for the Tutorial that shows how to read an Adafruit BMP280 temperature / pressure sensor.

main.cpp reads only temperature, to keep it simple, and to make it possible to simply clone / download and build.

Write step-by-step instructions for installing this repo and building/uploading it.

Refer to the "most basic" tutorial for most of the lines of code. Explain only the lines that are new in this tutorial.

Add some other file(s) that extends main.cpp to read temperature AND pressure and maybe altitude. Maybe show how
to add the test during initialization that checks for a valid sensor type.
